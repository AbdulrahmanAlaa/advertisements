* Guards to prevent unAuthenticated users from accessing routes.
* Unit Tests in Jasmin With Coverage that Exceeds `96%`.
* Custom SCSS with bootstrap 4.
* Angular Animation 
* Lazy loading Modules for faster application development 
* Enterprise application Structure to work in multible environment like `dev` and `prod`.

# My Choice
I did chose this approach because the angular framework comes with many preconfigured environment and helps to get in up and running projects very fast.Also the fast rendering using the Shadow DOM.
It Fits big companies as i worked in enterprise apps with both `AngularJS` and `Angular 5`
